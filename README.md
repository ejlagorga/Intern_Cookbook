Hey y'all,

I thought it would be a fun summer project to put together a cookbook with the target demographic being college interns who are living on their own, and as a result cooking for themselves, for the first time. I started by marking up some recipies in html, an example of which can be found in the example_recipe.html file. If everyone who wants to participate uses the same template to mark up their recipes we should have an interoperable cookbook which we could use publish to web as a resource, use to automatically generate shopping lists, or use for something else we think of along the way. In reality these goals are secondary to helping me in daily struggle against starvation this summer. If you have a recipe or and suggestion on how to improve the html template let me know.
